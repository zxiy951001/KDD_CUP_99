# KDD_CUP_99
KDDCUP99 Competition 


# Summary 
This is my attempt at data analysis of the KDDCUP99 dataset. 

Task 1: 

simple data analysis of dataset using basic mathematical functions: "mix, max, median, mean, standard deviation".


Task 2:

1) One-hot-encoding 

2) Developed an algorithm to distribute the values in column ‘src_bytes’ into 1 & 0 equally sized bins

3) Perform under sample on row “attack”

4) Using matplotlib to better visualise data
